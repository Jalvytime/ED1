<h1>Jackson Alvord Portfolio</h1>
<p><i>This reflection is about my reflection from my my first 3D printing project where I had to replicate a matchbox car.
<i></p>
<h3>Guidelines:</h3>
<p>Here are the guidelines to the 3D toy Car I replicated. </p>
<p>The Guidelines for this project are as follows, we are to replicate a toy 3 dimensional car. We first used calipers to find the length and dimensions of the toy car we had chosen. We wrote down the dimensions and everything we had found using the caliper. We then exported the design as an stl. After that we would then go on to orient the model in Cura for printing and exported as a gcode. The final design is then shared as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage.</p>

<h3>Process:</h3>
<p>Here, I will discuss the my approach to the project.</p>
<p>To start off the process, we first drew the car to scale on an Engineering Drawing. Then scan the Drawing and capture screenshots of each plane side. Draw each profile on each plane side then draw and place each profile to the matching plane side. By using the extrusion tool, remove all excess negative space. Use the fillet tools to add detail for finished product and export as an STL file. Then begin to slice and prepare to print by importing design into Cura. Cut and make final changes. Position 3D model on build plate to minimize support material and set nozzle to .6mm. Export as a GCODE file and Print Model 3D car. Documentation. Then import the design into Modelo to finalize and print the 3D model. The reflection of the 3D model should be an HTML document with blurb and 3D render. Add a photo of the car next to the model into Slide Deck.</p>
<h3>Setbacks and Solutions:</h3>
<p>Here I will discuss setbacks I had faced and their solutions.</p>
<p>Throughout my process, I had a challenging time with the engineering drawing. Figuring Out how to draw a 3D Car on paper with exact measurements was difficult. I also think my car would have been more precise if I had taken more time with my engineer drawing and gone over it a few times. One setback I had was when I needed to correct the measurements on my car in Onshape, I had to make my car skinner in width because the planes did not match each other. I was then able to extrude my car afterwards though. Another setback occurred when I realized I had to change the back of my car based on the original sketch. Because the top of my car wasn't not level, I needed to extrude my car differently and change how I would plan on lowering the back of my race car. I Initially believed that I would be unable to change the height of the car until I figured out how to extrude and place measurements at separate parts of the car.</p>
